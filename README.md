# DevOps Project
This repository showcases my skills and experience with the command interpreter in Linux. It includes a set of shell scripts that cover basic and advanced topics in shell scripting.

# Project Structure
The project is organized into several directories, each containing shell scripts that cover a specific topic:

- 0x00-shell_basics: covers basic shell commands such as cd, ls, mkdir, rm, pwd, etc.
- 0x01-shell_permissions: covers file permissions and ownership in Linux, including chmod, chown, sudo, etc.
- 0x02-shell_redirections: covers input/output redirection in shell scripts, including >, >>, <, <<, etc.
- 0x03-shell_variables_expansions: covers variables and expansions in shell scripts, including ${}, $$, $(), !, etc.
In addition, the project includes the following files:

- README.md: provides an overview of the project and its contents.
- index.html: a sample HTML file that can be used to test the shell scripts.
